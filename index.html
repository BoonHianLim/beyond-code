                The rise of website builders has simplified online presence
                creation for individuals and businesses. However, existing
                platforms face limitations which hinder broader adoption. This
                study investigates the current landscape of website builders
                through case studies and user surveys, uncovering common
                limitations such as customisability, inaccurate documentation
                and lack of versioning tools. The study further explores
                innovative opportunities to tackle them from these insights,
                such as a Large Language Model (LLM) powered frontend UI
                generation functionality, a Plugins-of-Plugins system, an HTML
                importation system, and an automated documentation generation
                feature. This study then successfully proves these features'
                technical feasibility through experiments and implementation by
                building a proof-of-concept website builder. Additionally,
                through experiments, it is found that passing the partial design
                or sketch is a valid approach to make minor modifications to the
                current HTML codebase, and commercial models outperform
                open-source models in this task.

        <h2 class="title is-3">Introduction</h2>
        <h2 class="title is-4">Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the easy-to-use features of website builders and the large
          population adopting website builders,
          <b
            >the user experience of building a website on such platforms is not
            necessarily good.</b

        </p>
        <h2 class="title is-4">Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          We attempt to understand the current landscape of website builders. We
          achieve this by conducting a <b>two-phase approach</b> to identify the
          <b>limitations</b> and <b>opportunities for innovation</b> in website
          builders. <br /><br />
          For the 1st phase, we aim to understand the
          <u>limitations of existing website builders</u> by conducting a
          <b>case study</b> on existing website builders and a
          <b>user survey</b> to gather insights from users. <br /><br />
          For the 2nd phase, we propose a set of features that can address the
          limitations identified in the first phase. To
          <u>ascertain the technical feasibility</u> of these features, we
          conduct <b>experiments</b> and <b>implementation</b> to prove that
          these features can be implemented in a website builder.

        <h2 class="title is-3">Limitations of Website Builders</h2>
        <p>
          We found <b>lack of customisability</b>,
          <b>inaccurate documentation</b>, and <b>poor versioning tools</b> to
          be the most common limitations in website builders. These findings
          remain consistent across case studies and user surveys.
        </p>
        <img src="./static/images/limitations.png" alt="Limitations" />
        <h2 class="title is-4">Case Studies</h2>
        <p>
          We help FOGG, a company that designs learning programmes for children,
          to <b>build a website for their business need</b>. We take over their
          existing websites built on Wix, and build on top of it to identify the
          limitations of existing website builders. We also conduct a case study
          on website builders such as WordPress and 10Web AI Builder to obtain a
          deeper understanding of website builders' features and limitations.
        </p>
        <p>The followings are the limitations we found in the case studies:</p>

        <ul class="limitations-list">
          <li>Lack of customisability</li>
          <ul>
            <li>No native support on localisation</li>
            <p>
              There were no native support for localisation in Wix CMS (Wix
              Booking Plugin). We had to use Wix Velo (Wix's JavaScript-based
              development platform) to implement the localisation feature.

                />
              </details>
            </p>

            <li>Unsupported designs</li>
            <p>
              Some designs are not supported by the website builder, such as
              calendars with custom designs or scroll bars. We had to either
              implement workarounds using
              <a

                >custom elements</a
              >
              or forgo certain design elements altogether.

            </p>
          </ul>
          <li>Inaccurate documentation</li>

          The documentation provided by the website builders is often inaccurate
          or incomplete, making it difficult to understand how to use certain
          features.
          <br />For example:

          <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: normal">
              Wix Bookings API returns erroneous error responses that are not
              documented, leading to confusion.
            </li>

            <li style="font-weight: normal">
              We also encountered some fields returned in the responses without
              explanations on what they are used for.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <details>
            <summary>See Image</summary>
            <img
              src="./static/images/case-study-limitations-documentation.png"
              alt="Inaccurate Documentation"
            />
          </details>
          <p></p>
          <li>Poor versioning tools</li>
          We found that the versioning tools provided by the website builders
          are not sufficient for our needs.
          <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: normal">
              For example, Wix's versioning tools do not allow us to compare
              different versions of the website.
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal">
              We also found that all editors shared the same revision. If one
              user reverts, all users are forced to revert.
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal">
              We also found that the versioning tools only maintain a linear
              history. Reverting will erase all changes after the recovered
              snapshot.
            </li>
          </ul>

            />
          </details>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="title is-4">User Surveys</h2>
        <p>
          We collected 21 valid responses from the user survey after filtering
          out those that did not meet the criteria (e.g., irrelevant responses,
          responses finishing too quickly).
          <br />The survey results show that the most common limitations in
          website builders are <b>lack of customisability</b>,
          <b>poor editing experience</b>, <b>inaccurate documentation</b>, and
          <b>poor versioning tools</b>. These findings are consistent with the
          case studies conducted.

        <h2 class="title is-3">Experiment: Partial Frontend UI Generation</h2>
        <h2 class="title is-4">Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          During our case study, we saw a pattern where
          <b>the business owner modified the design of some small components</b>
          from the layout the external contractors designed. We argue that
          partial frontend UI generation is valuable, especially for
          non-technical people, such as SME owners or product managers, to
          <b
            >make minor changes without having to worry about the underlying
            code.</b
          >
          This helps with customisability in website builders.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title is-4">Data Preparation</h2>
        <h3 class="title is-5">High-fidelity Design</h3>
        We duplicated the 25 web pages into a dataset of 50 web pages. For each
        web page, we perform the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            We randomly chose one group of components we wished to remove
            afterwards, which must be next to each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            We took a full screenshot of the original web page and extracted the
            screenshot of those components.
          </li>
          <li>
            Afterwards, we manually removed that one chosen group of components
            from the HTML code and replaced it with a &lt;missing&gt; tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            We then applied uncss, a popular JavaScript library for minifying
            CSS, to remove all the unused CSS from the codebase.
          </li>
        </ol>
        We refer to this web page with the &lt;missing&gt; tag as “Partial HTML”
        in the later sections.
        <img
          src="./static/images/methodology-design-to-code.png"
          alt="High-fidelity Design Preparation"
        />
        <h3 class="title is-5">Sketch</h3>
        We perform the similar steps for the sketches, except that:
        <ol>
          <li>
            We manually drew the sketches based on the one selected component
            group.
          </li>
          <li>
            We also overlapped our sketch to the selected component group in the
            screenshot for prompting purpose later in the experiments.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <img
          src="./static/images/methodology-sketch-to-code.png"
          alt="High-fidelity Sketch Preparation"
        />
        <h2 class="title is-4">Prompting Methods</h2>

        We evaluate the VLLMs using four different methods:

        <ol>
          <li>Merging</li>
          We remove the &lt;missing&gt; label from partial HTML and feed it
          together with a merged screenshot of the new design/sketch. The VLLM
          identifies and inserts or modifies the code as needed.
          <li>Merging with Hint</li>
          We keep the &lt;missing&gt; tag in the partial HTML as a hint, and ask
          the VLLM to replace it using the merged screenshot of the new
          design/sketch.
          <li>Fixed-sized with Hint</li>
          We provide partial HTML with the &lt;missing&gt; tag and the
          design/sketch of the removed component group rendered at a fixed width
          of 1280 pixels, based on previous studies and tool defaults.
          <li>Varied-sized with Hint</li>
          We provide partial HTML with the &lt;missing&gt; tag and the
          design/sketch of the removed component group in varied sizes. This
          accounts for users preparing designs/sketches without fixed widths,
          ensuring readability and responsiveness even if sketches differ
          slightly from the original layout.

        <h2 class="title is-4">Research Questions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Which prompting method consistently produces the most accurate code?
            <ul>
              <li>
                Open-source models:
                <ul>
                  <li>Merging</li>
                  <li>Overall lower score</li>

              </li>
            </ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            How consistent are the VLLMs in the tasks?
            <ul>
              <li>Open source models:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>100% success rate other than Gemma2:27b</li>
                <li>
                  Mostly generate in one go, sometimes need multiple iterations
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Commercial models:</li>

          <li>
            How responsive is the code generated by VLLMs?

            <ul>

              <li>Ranging from 0.01 to 0.02, most less than 0.01</li>
              <li>
                Generated websites remains responsive, as HTMLs in our test
                dataset are all responsive

          <li>
            Does the fidelity of the input affect VLLM's performance?
            <br />
            Instead of using the design, we use the sketch dataset to evaluate
            the VLLMs' performance. We found the trend to be similar to the
            high-fidelity design dataset, as shown in the results below:
            <ul>
              <li>Open-source models:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Merging & Merging with Hint</li>
                <li>Overall lower score</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Commercial models:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Varied-Sized with Hint</li>
                <li>High score</li>
                <li>Gemini-2.0 Flash and GPT-4o remains top performers</li>

            </ul>

        <h2 class="title is-3">Implementation</h2>
        By extending
        <a src="https://github.com/GrapesJS/grapesjs">GrapesJS</a>, an
        open-source website builder, we create a website builder with our
        proposed solutions:
        <ol>
          <li>Frontend UI Generation</li>
          <li>Plugins-of-Plugins Systems</li>
          <li>HTML Importation System</li>
          <li>Automated Documentation Generation</li>
        </ol>
        We chose GrapesJS as it is:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Simple and does not have complex features such as dashboards or
            access control, making it much simpler to extend.
          </li>
          <li>
            Its capability of importing HTML and CSS code provides at least two
            benefits that align with our project vision:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Users can directly modify the HTML and CSS while allowing drag
                and drop. This feature addresses our survey respondent's
                suggestion in the user survey, where he proposed that it would
                be easier to implement some features in pure HTML and CSS. If a
                feature is more straightforward to do in HTML, the user can go
                directly for it.
              </li>
              <li>
                It allows non-technical users to make minor modifications to the
                existing layout of the websites, even though they may lack
                technical knowledge.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
